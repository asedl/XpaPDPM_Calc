Testdata Information

The test files contained in this distribution include both input data as well as the expected results. 
The location of the expected results can be found at the following offsets which depend upon the version of the OASIS assessment:

Flat file format
	OASIS-C - From Offset Position 880 to Offset Position 954
	OASIS-C (v2.10) - From Offset Position 1086 to Offset Position 1160
	OASIS-C1 (v2.11, v2.12) - From Offset Position 1086 to Offset Position 1160

	OASIS-D (v2.30.1) - From Offset Position 1086 to Offset Position 1160

XML file format - since XML uses tags there is not specific offset of the expected results, but instead the following tags 
within the <ASSESSMENT>  (with example values):
	<EXPECTED_RESULT>
		<HIPPS>3AGKS</HIPPS>
		<TAC>09GK16AA42APADAKAA</TAC>
		<VERSION>V5115</VERSION>
		<FLAG>1</FLAG>
	</EXPECTED_RESULT>
