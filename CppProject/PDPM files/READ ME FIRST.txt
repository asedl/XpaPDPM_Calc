PDPM Grouper DLL and Source Code V1.00 (BETA)

INTRODUCTION:
This is a preliminary BETA release of the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM) Grouper software.  Effective beginning October 1, 2019, the PDPM will be used under the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System (PPS) for classifying SNF patients in a covered Part A stay.  For information on the PDPM logic, please visit https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/SNFPPS/PDPM.html.

DISCLAIMER:
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, CMS and its contractors/distributors make no representations about the suitability, for any purpose or use, of the software and documents. THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ANY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. Recipient shall not, in any event, be entitled to, and CMS or contractors/distributors shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any nature including, without being limited to, loss of use, data, or profit irrespective of the nature of the claim, whether in contract, tort, warranty, or otherwise.

DESCRIPTION:
This BETA package contains the C++ source code as well as a compiled Windows-based DLL.  The source code also contains files to support calls in the UNIX environment.  The software is in the testing phase, which has NOT been completed.  If the software does not return the HIPPS Code that is expected, please contact the PDPM Support team at PDPM@cms.hhs.gov.

A single method is provided for use by other programs - it is named mdsgrouper.  This method supports the use of the MDS submission fixed-length string as input to the grouper.  (NOTE:  An additional method to support the MDS submission XML format as input will be forthcoming in the production release.) The method declaration is as follows:

mdsgrouper( char* pdpmRecord, char* HIPPSCode,  int* errorcode, char* HIPPSVersionCode );

The parameters for this method are not expected to change for the final production release.

Parameter definitions:

pdpmRecord - A 3690-byte fixed-length string containing a MDS assessment in the format defined by the MDS 3.0 Data Specifications V3.00.1, which go into production on October 1, 2019.

HIPPSCode - The resulting 5-character HIPPS Code returned by the method.

errorcode - An integer code indicating whether an error was encountered.  Currently, this parameter returns 0 if no errors were encountered in processing the assessment, and it returns 5 if errors are encountered.  Additional error codes may be defined for the final release.

HIPPSVersionCode - The version code for the PDPM software, which is "1.0000" for this release.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

This version of the software is BETA and MUST NOT BE USED for production purposes.  In addition to the possibility of errors found as testing continues, this software uses the same ICD-10 codes as the SAS-based PDPM grouper already posted on the CMS site...and those codes have NOT been updated to reflect the ICD-10 codes in effect on October 1, 2019!

In addition to ICD-10 updates and fixes to any bugs, the final release of the PDPM Grouper will also contain support for MDS Submission XML files as input to the grouper, test files for use with the grouper, as well as formal documentation.

Once again, please report any issues by contacting the PDPM Support team, using the following email address: PDPM@cms.hhs.gov.
