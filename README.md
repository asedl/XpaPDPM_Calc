# XpaPDPM_Calc
Magic Xpa Demo project for PDPM Grouper DLL 

Project includes:
+ Visual Studio (2019) project with modified sources from PDPM@cms.hhs.gov
+ A Magic XPa (Single User) Demo project
+ Some Testdata

**This first version is based on a BETA version of the PDPM Grouper DLL: 
V1.00 (BETA) released a few month ago. Another version of this project will replace/update that with the latest version of that sources, for which a final version has been released just a few days ago. More information about that DLL and versions:** 
[MDS 3.0 Technical Information](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/NHQIMDS30TechnicalInformation.html) ** 

Documentation and stuff follows, for now simply copy the DLL from /bin directory of this repository to your Magic directory, open the Magic Xpa Test project and have a look into the test program(s) there. If you clone or download the repository from here, you will only get the sources and you need to build the binaries yourself. Alternatively you can download a released version, which then has the binaries included: https://github.com/asedl/XpaPDPM_Calc/releases 

In this initial version we did not really check what the requirements (buffer size, ..) for the parameters are and documentation does not really exist for that DLL either. We'll add that information after some testing with next version and document it.  

**This version of the XpaPDPM_Calc project and it's pdpm.dll is only for testing purposes**
